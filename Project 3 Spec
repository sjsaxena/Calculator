Display graph of an expression over a range of x values

Add fields...
for X, to X, increment
Set initial value of "increment" to 1

User defines EITHER toX OR increments. Always show 10 increments of x

Show 5-20 points on plot in the set x-range

	 - toX should be greater than increment
	 - difference should be big enough to plot a few points
	 - "too many" graph points should not be allowed
	 	(-100 to 100 by 1)

Allow a max of 20 X-scale values
	 	- JUST ASK USER TO ADJUST THESE

We have to decide on Y-scale values. 
	Probably wont be one-toone with X scale tick marks or with the Y expression values. Show as many as X scale are being shown?

have a prepareGraphData() method that calls evaluate() in a loop to create two arrays of double for X and Y values for plotting. 

Write a separate program to do graphing, that takes data points and window points. Creates a new window for each graph.

	- Graphing program figures out Y scale and tick marks...

	- extend JPanel and provide a paint() method
		public void paint(Graphics g)
			{
			}	

		Do ALL graph drawing by calling methods on g in the paint() method

		In the constructor, add "this" to "Center" of the graphWindow. 

		When you call graphWindow.setVisible(true) at the bottom of constructor, the window will call the paint() method on its components.

		When the user resizes a window, the window calls the paint() method of all compnents.

		Recalculate the size of the screen and replot everything relative to that size

Calculator should load a new copy of Grapher for each graph that is requested



Add a "What is the value at this point?" feature.
	- user can click the poinse and a window will pop up at the point and display what the x and y values are for the expression. 

	- call evaluate() back in Calculator program.. look at the spec.
